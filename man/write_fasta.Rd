\title{Write a named vector of sequences to FASTA file}
\usage{
write_fasta(sequences, fn)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{named character vector with sequences (names become FASTA headers)}

\item{fn}{name of the file - can be zipped (with "gz" file extension)}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
Write a named vector of sequences to FASTA file
}
\details{
The function creates a properly formatted FASTA file with:
\itemize{
  \item Headers starting with ">" followed by sequence identifiers
  \item Sequence data on single lines (no wrapping)
  \item One sequence per entry
  \item Automatic compression detection for .gz files
}
}
\examples{
# Create example sequences
sequences <- c("ATCGATCGATCGATCG", "GCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA", "TTAACCGGTTAACCGG")
names(sequences) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3")

# Write to FASTA file
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".fasta")
write_fasta(sequences, temp_file)

# Write to compressed file
temp_file_gz <- tempfile(fileext = ".fasta.gz")
write_fasta(sequences, temp_file_gz)

# Write unnamed sequences (will get generic names)
unnamed_seqs <- c("ATCG", "GCTA", "TTAA")
temp_file_unnamed <- tempfile(fileext = ".fasta")
write_fasta(unnamed_seqs, temp_file_unnamed)

}
